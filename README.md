# About This Repository
The code in this repository implements various mathematical algorithms and can help check your answers to problems from the MATH2400 (Finite Mathematics) course at UNSW.

This is a work in progress.

Current algorithms include:
- Euclidean algorithm
- Extended Euclidean algorithm

Coming soon:
- Integer base conversion (up to and including base-36)
- Decimal fraction base conversion (from decimal to another base)
