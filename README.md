# About This Repository
The code in this repository implements various mathematical algorithms and can help check your answers to problems from the MATH2400 (Finite Mathematics) course at UNSW.

**This is a work in progress.**

**Current algorithms include:**
- Euclidean algorithm
- Extended Euclidean algorithm
- Integer base conversion (up to and including base-36)
- Decimal fraction base conversion (from decimal to another base)

**Coming soon:**
- Calculating convergends and error bounds from partial quotients
